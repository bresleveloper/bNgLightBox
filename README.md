# bNgLightBox
a simple directive to create angular content in a light box

my focus was to make usage as simple as it can gets, so just wrap you ng-code with the directive and give it the events functions, meaning on-open, on-close, and on-save, and even the css-class for the buttons.

your code will look like this
    
    <b-ng-light-box attributes...>  
      angular or html code....
    </b-ng-light-box>  
see the <a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/wILek74reuOXD00q8gsM?p=preview">plunker</a>

it include a simple directive js, a simple ng-template script, and 4 lines of css, availabe in either 3 seperate files or in 1 html file up here
